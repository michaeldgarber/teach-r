[**Key resources I would recommend:**]{.underline}

I mostly use packages that are a part of the tidyverse or which work well with the tidyverse (e.g., sf). The R universe has lots of helpful and free online resources on those and other topics. Here are some that I'd recommend:

-   For **general data wrangling** and other data management in the tidyverse (dplyr and other tidyverse packages)

    -   Tidyverse home page: <https://www.tidyverse.org/>

    -   dplyr home page: <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/>

    -   R for Data Science: <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>.

        -   This book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund is the authoritative guide for learning dplyr and other tidyverse packages.

        -   The chapter on **dplyr** specifically is <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html>.

    -   For importing rectangular data (e.g., CSV) using readr: <https://readr.tidyverse.org/>

    -   For explanation of more "under-the-hood" technical topics, I would suggest <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/>

-   For **manipulating spatial data** (sf)

    -   sf home page: <https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html>

    -   vignettes (1-5), e.g., <https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html>

    -   Geocomputation with R (Lovelace, Nowosad, Muenchow) : <https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/>

        -   Key chapters on managing sf:

            -   <https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html>

            -   <https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html>

        -   This book also covers raster data and corresponding packages (terra and raster).

    -   Chapter on sf in Spatial Data Science (Pebesma, Bivand): <https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app/sf.html#sfintro>

-   For **making charts and figures** (ggplot2)

    -   ggplot2 home page: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/>

    -   cookbook: <http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/>

    -   ggplot2 cheat sheet: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf>

    -   Data visualization principles: book (not free) by Kieran Healy, <https://kieranhealy.org/publications/dataviz/>

-   For **making maps** (mapview, tmap, ggplot2)

    -   Chapter on making maps in Geocomputation with R: <https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html>

    -   Mapview is my favorite mapping package, in part for its simplicity.

        -   Its home page is <https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/>

        -   Several vignettes are available on that page, e.g., <https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/articles/mapview_01-basics.html>

    -   Tmap is another widely used mapping package and can create both static and interactive maps.

        -   <https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/index.html>

        -   <https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/tmap-getstarted.html>

        -   <https://cengel.github.io/R-spatial/mapping.html#choropleth-with-tmap>

    -   ggplot2 can also be used to make static maps of sf objects:

        -   <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html>

        -   Chapter in Spatial Data Science: <https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app/plotting.html#geomsf>

    -   Color palettes:

        -   viridis: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html>

            -   Note viridis is often the default option in mapview.

            -   Note viridis is built into some ggplot2 functions.

        -   RColorBrewer:

            -   website to see color palettes: [https://colorbrewer2.org/](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3)

            -   R package: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html>

-   Other **miscellaneous** resources I frequently use and reading I recommend:

    -   RStudio cheatsheets on dplyr, ggplot2, and more: <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>
